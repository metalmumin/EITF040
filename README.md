ETIF040
=======

This project is a part of the course Digital Projects (EITF040), given at Sweden's Faculty of Engineering, LTH in Lund. This project focuses on constructing a chromatic guitar tuner with an ATmega16. The tuner tunes any electric instrument that can be connected to the tuner using a 3.5mm analog jack. Seven LED diodes will indicate the offset of the  instrument's string. The tuner will use the ATmega16â€™s internal ADC to measure the frequencies, whereas conventionally Voltage-Controlled Oscillators are used.
